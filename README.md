# Project Happy Thoughts API

In the Happy Thoughts project week 7 we built a frontend in React which uses an API to store thoughts in chatboard. <br/>
This week we built our own API which works in the same way and is now tested out in the previous Happy Thoughts frontend project.
We can write a new 'happy thought', list recent thoughts, and show a count of 'hearts/like' on each thought. Users could then click the heart to like a thought and post new happy thoughts.

Routes: <br/>
/thougths - use either GET or POST to see a list of thoughts or post a new one. <br/>
/thoughts/:thoughtId/like - increases the number of hearts/likes on a post <br/>
## The problem

How to use POST requests to send data to your API 

✓ How to store data in your database from POST requests <br/>
✓ How to validate data and ensure your database only contains 'good' data <br/>
✓ How to build a full API which includes handling of user input <br/>
✓ How to build an API which works well with an existing frontend <br/>
